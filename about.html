        <h2>About this little project</h2>
        <p>Hello.</p>
        <p>The idea came one day when I realized just how much I struggled finding a perfect reminder application for myself. Without further ado, I started sketching and communicating with my two favorite people to see how would such an application be made, designed, implemented. Let me tell you one thing...It sure is not an easy task to do, but its fruits are fully rewarding.</p>
        <p>I will continue to grow and create applications that can help people achieve what they need, and this is just the first stepping stone in my journey.</p>
        <p>It will forever remain free,<br> As all good things do in the end.<br> Until then my dear stranger, <br> Have a nice journey!</p>
